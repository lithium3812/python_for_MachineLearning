## Assignments and projects in a machine learning Udemy course

These files are assignments and projects I worked on in a Udemy Machine Learning course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla.

It started with the basics of python and common libraries like numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and then discussed principles of machine learning.

The course covered most of the popular machine learning algorithms. The folder name indicates the focus of the project inside, or the adopted algorithm.

## Assignments and projects in a machine learning Udemy course

These files are assignments and projects I worked on in a Udemy Machine Learning course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/

I did not include other notebooks used for demonstration by the instructor.

It started with the basics of python and common libraries like numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and then discussed principles of machine learning. I did not include most of the projects of python basics and visualization.

The course covered most of the popular machine learning algorithms. The folder name indicates the focus of the project inside, or the adopted algorithm.

### Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering

### Projects
- Data visualization/analysis final projects. One analyzes a kaggle 911 call data, and the other is a stock price data.
- Ecommerce customer behaviour analysis by Linear regression.
- Logistic regression model for web advertisement and customer behavior.
- Classification problem with unexplained features by KNN algorithm.
- Decision tree and random forest model to predict which debtors will highly probably fully pay back and which will not.
- Classification of the famous iris flower dataset. Here only a few features of different iris species are available and the distribution of each species are somewhat overlapping. This is a typical case where SVM can be a powerful tool.
- Classify universities data with various features into two groups, i.e., prvate or public, by k-means clustering.
